`{{datum_name}}` is replaced with whatever is at that index in the provided object

`{{[array_name}}` is iterated across
`#(array_name)` is the way to access an iterator, where `#(array_name).item` is the object returned at any given moment and `#(array_name).index` the index at which it was found ; it is possible to nest iterators, and they can be used with both arrays and objects
`{{]array_name}}` ends the iteration of a template

an example lies in `demo/` which makes clear the API

practice not-doing,
and everything will fall into place
